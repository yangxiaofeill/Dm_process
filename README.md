# All the R script used to process the genome of `D. melanogaster`

`pqsfinderG4.R` is used to detect G4 structures from a genome

`G4_bin_enrichment.R` is make enrichment analysis of each genomic bin for the G4 and i-Motif structures



`nonSyn_Novel_Seq.R` is used to detect novel sequence from syri synteny results for `D. melanogaster` genome

`ProteinFamilyEnrichmentFunction.R` is used to make enrichment analysis of protein families of the novel predicted genes

`RepeatMasker_bin_enrichment.R` is make enrichment analysis of each genomic bin for different repeat families
